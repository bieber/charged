Charged is a puzzle game, albeit at the moment an entirely incomplete one.

The objective of the game is to place charged particles on a map such that their 
interactions with the other elements of the map ends with a particle striking a 
target to complete the level.

The entire project is made available as the system "charged" in charged.asd.  
Just use asdf:load-system or ql:quickload to load the system and then run 
(charged:main) to start.
